# GossipP2P
Project: Gossip-Based Peer-to-Peer Network 

A Python-based peer-to-peer network that leverages the Gossip Protocol for communication between nodes. The network allows nodes to exchange information, such as subscribed topics and other node details, in real-time. This project supports both small data requests (e.g., JSON-based node info) and large data transmission (e.g., images or arrays). It utilizes socket programming for communication and multithreading for concurrent data handling. Nodes automatically discover and connect with other peers, forming a decentralized and dynamic network.
